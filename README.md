This implements a stage with an image slider which automatically lets you see the images by stepping through them one after the other. All the stepping through is timed and indicated by an transition animation within the pager showing on the bottom of the images: it gets filled and after the transition finished, it triggers the update to show the next image.

Quite nice and smooth.
